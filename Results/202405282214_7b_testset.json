The correct answer is (c) 3:1. This ratio is calculated by dividing the number of offspring with vestigial wings (2) by the number of offspring with normal wings (2), which gives a ratio of 2:2. However, the Punnett square shows that there are 2 boxes with the genotype NN and 2 boxes with the genotype Nn. Since Nn is the genotype for both normal wings and vestigial wings, the actual ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:1.
