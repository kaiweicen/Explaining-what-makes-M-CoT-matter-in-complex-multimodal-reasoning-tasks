The F allele is dominant over the f allele. This means that the F allele will be expressed in the phenotype of the sheep, and the f allele will not be expressed.\nThe expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This is because the F allele is dominant, and the only way for an offspring to have a hairy fleece is if it inherits the recessive f allele from both parents. Since the parents are both FF, the only possible genotype for the offspring is FF, which results in a woolly fleece.", "a) shiny provin provin provin provin provin provintypenesstypeness\nWhat is the type of the object in the image?\nThe type of the object in the image is a crown.", "c) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 provin provin cerem cerem, ceram, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, ceramic, cer", "d) Cheyenne provin provin provin provin provintypentypentypen typen\nType A is a type of blood that is known for its ability to be used in blood transfusions.

The problem was to design a new city park that would have space for outdoor concerts and at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. He then tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\n\nThe test results showed that the design with the concert area closest to the road had the least amount of traffic noise during the concerts.

To test this, she puts guards made of lightweight metal on one drone and observes how well it flies.\n\nCharlotte's test is designed to show if adding the blade guards makes the drone fly poorly. If the drone flies poorly with the guards, then Charlotte can conclude that the guards are too heavy and need to be redesigned or replaced with lighter materials.
