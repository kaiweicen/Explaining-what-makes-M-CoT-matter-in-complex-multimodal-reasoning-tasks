Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets. In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.", "image": "image.png", "task": "closed choice", "grade": "grade8", "subject": "natural science", "topic": "biology", "category": "Genes to traits", "skill": "Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types", "lecture": "Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n", "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece. A woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff. All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff. A hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff. There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece.

Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times.

People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East.

The farmers and cats probably helped one another. It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way. Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night.

In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.\nThe volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents.

For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\nTo multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.", "image": "image.png", "task": "closed choice", "grade": "grade8", "subject": "natural science", "topic": "biology", "category": "Genes to traits", "skill": "Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types", "lecture": "Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n", "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings. Vestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn. There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below. Normal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn. There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
