The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.  Gordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.

To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n", "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.\nSmooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.\nFuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit.

An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.

The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.\nFertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.\nThe mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.", "solution": "After they are released, spores can land on the ground and germinate.

The farmers and cats probably helped one another. It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way. Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil.

These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n", "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.\nYellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.\nRed fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0.

Later, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated. After the moth pollinates the flower, the petunia is able to reproduce.

Kenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft. So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues. Researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages. What Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another. The researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people.

One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?", "solution": "", "split": "test", "image_id": "19118"}, {"question": "What is the capital of North Carolina?", "choices": ["Milwaukee", "Raleigh", "Boise", "Jackson"], "answer": 1, "hint": "", "image": "image.png", "task": "closed choice", "grade": "grade4", "subject": "social science", "topic": "geography", "category": "State capitals", "skill": "Identify state capitals of the Southeast", "lecture": "", "solution": "Raleigh is the capital of North Carolina.", "split": "test", "image_id": "19122"}, {"question": "Which ocean is highlighted?", "choices": ["the Southern Ocean", "the Pacific Ocean", "the Atlantic Ocean", "the Indian Ocean"], "answer": 1, "hint": "", "image": "image.png", "task": "closed choice", "grade": "grade7", "subject": "social science", "topic": "geography", "category": "Physical Geography", "skill": "Oceans and continents", "lecture": "Oceans are huge bodies of salt water.

These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study. In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.", "image": "image.png", "task": "closed choice", "grade": "grade8", "subject": "natural science", "topic": "biology", "category": "Genes to traits", "skill": "Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types", "lecture": "Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n", "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.\nVestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn.
