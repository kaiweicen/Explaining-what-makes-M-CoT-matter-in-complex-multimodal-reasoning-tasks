Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a dwarf body. A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene.

A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb. All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb. So, the expected ratio of offspring with a dwarf body to offspring with a normal-sized body is 0:4.

Sloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches. For example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot. Sloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees. Hanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive.

Blue body feathers is the recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait.

A budgerigar parakeet with the dominant version of the body feather color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with green body feathers must have the genotype BB or Bb. All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.

There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures. One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm. Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what. Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time.

So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.\nArrows show how matter moves.\nA food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.\nAn organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it.

So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n", "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dark yellow flowers or light yellow flowers, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the flower color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for light yellow flowers, is dominant over the f allele, which is for dark yellow flowers. Dark yellow flowers is the recessive allele's version of the flower color trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the flower color trait must have only recessive alleles for the flower color gene. So, offspring with dark yellow flowers must have the genotype ff. There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. Light yellow flowers is the dominant allele's version of the flower color trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the flower color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the flower color gene. So, offspring with light yellow flowers must have the genotype FF or Ff. All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with dark yellow flowers to offspring with light yellow flowers is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dark yellow flowers. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with light yellow flowers.", "split": "val", "image_id": "16770"}, {"question": "Is the following statement about our solar system true or false? 75% of the planets are made mainly of rock.", "choices": ["true", "false"], "answer": 1, "hint": "Use the data to answer the question below.", "image": "image.png", "task": "true-or false", "grade": "grade6", "subject": "natural science", "topic": "earth-science", "category": "Astronomy", "skill": "Analyze data to compare properties of planets", "lecture": "A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.\nThe primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of.

In a group of cheetahs, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a king coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

The question tells you that the a allele, which is for a king coat, is recessive to the A allele, which is for a spotted coat. A king coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cheetah with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a king coat must have the genotype aa. There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. A spotted coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cheetah with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a spotted coat must have the genotype AA or Aa. All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa. So, the expected ratio of offspring with a king coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 0:4.

Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.\nNewer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain.

The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

Having myotonia congenita is the dominant allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait.

So, the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita is 4:0.

So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype aa. There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below. A spotted coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A leopard with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a spotted coat must have the genotype AA or Aa. There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below. So, the expected ratio of offspring with a black coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 1:3.

In many ways, though, okapis are quite different from their giraffe cousins. An okapi's neck is much shorter than a giraffe's. This is useful, because a long neck would make it difficult to move through thick vegetation. Another important difference is that giraffes are social and live in herds, while okapis are shy, solitary creatures. They tend to live alone, hiding in the dense forest.
